#Compiler Construction

The repository contains the compiler implementation for a custom language as a part of course work for CS 419 Compilers - FCAI-HU - Based on Compiler Construction Principles and Practice Book  

The language in the Project is a case sensitive object-oriented language with 
support for inheritance and encapsulation. A program in Project #2 consists 
of a class definition which contains a sequence of function definitions. Each 
function consists in turn of variable declarations, type declarations, function 
declarations, and statements. The types in Project #1 are very restricted look 
at table 1.In addition ,there are arrays of Integers Ilap id[ n ] there are arrays 
of Booleans : Logical id‘[’ n ‘]’ where n is an integer. The array index value 
can only be simple unary expression such as an identifier, a constant or 
another simple array access expression. Access to structure types can be 
done using the “object dereferencing” operator (“.”).

The Scanner is running on ASP.NET Core.
